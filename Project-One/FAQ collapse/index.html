                 to its risk weighted assets and current liabilities. It is decided by central banks

                Engine. It makes sense to start with the most important part under the hood of a vehicle,
                 which is the engine. Most modern vehicles run on internal combustion engines, 
                 which generate energy by igniting a mixture of air and fuel that moves pistons, 
                 which in turn move the car.

                about three per cent from the nine-year low of 78 million in 2020 due to the pandemic,
